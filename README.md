#### 2. Create an API for address registration
  * It needs to have endpoints for the 4 operations: create address, update address, delete address and list the addresses.
  * The data to be saved will be: street address, number, neighborhood and the city ID.
  * You must have an endpoint to list cities.
  * For the create address and update address endpoints it is relevant to validate the data received in the form request.
